You can use the libraries through Maven central repository by adding the
following to your project pom.xml file.
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.haifengl</groupId>
      <artifactId>smile-core</artifactId>
      <version>2.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

For NLP, use the artifactId smile-nlp.

For Scala API, please use
```
    libraryDependencies += "com.github.haifengl" %% "smile-scala" % "2.4.0"
```

For Kotlin API, add the below into the `dependencies` section
of Gradle build script.
```
    implementation("com.github.haifengl:smile-kotlin:2.4.0")
```

For Clojure API, add the following dependency to your project or build file:
```
    [org.clojars.haifengl/smile "2.4.0"]
```

By default, Smile leverages OpenBLAS for optimized matrix computation.
If you don't use algorithms depending on matrix computation, you may
exclude the dependcy to save space:
```
    libraryDependencies += "com.github.haifengl" % "smile-core" % "2.5.0" exclude("org.bytedeco", "arpack-ng-platform")
```

If you prefer other BLAS implementations, you can use any library found on
the "java.library.path" or on the class path, by specifying it with the
"org.bytedeco.openblas.load" system property. For example, to use the BLAS
library from the Accelerate framework on Mac OS X, we can pass options such
as `-Djava.library.path=/usr/lib/ -Dorg.bytedeco.openblas.load=blas`.

For a default installation of MKL that would be `-Dorg.bytedeco.openblas.load=mkl_rt`.
Or you may simply include `smile-mkl` module in your project, which includes MKL binaries.
With `smile-mkl` module in the class path, Smile will automatically switch to MKL.
No need to specify `-Dorg.bytedeco.openblas.load=mkl_rt`.
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.haifengl</groupId>
      <artifactId>smile-mkl</artifactId>
      <version>2.5.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

## Shell
Smile comes with interactive shells for Java, Scala and Kotlin.
In the home directory of Smile, type
```
    ./bin/smile
```
to enter the Scala shell. You can run any valid Scala expressions
in the shell. In the simplest case, you can use it as a calculator.
Besides, all high-level Smile operators are predefined in the shell.
By default, the shell uses up to 75% memory. If you need more memory
to handle large data, use the option `-J-Xmx` or `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage`.
For example,
```
    ./bin/smile -J-Xmx30G
```
You can also modify the configuration file `./conf/smile.ini` for the
memory and other JVM settings.

To use Java's JShell, type
```
    ./bin/jshell.sh
```
which has Smile's jars in the classpath. Similarly, run
```
    ./bin/kotlin.sh
```
to enter Kotlin REPL.

## Model Serialization
Most models support the Java `Serializable` interface (all classifiers
do support `Serializable` interface) so that you can use them in Spark.
For reading/writing the models in non-Java code, we suggest XStream
(https://github.com/x-stream/xstream) to serialize the trained models.
XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again.
XStream is easy to use and doesn't require mappings (actually requires
no modifications to objects). Protostuff(http://code.google.com/p/protostuff/)
is a nice alternative that supports forward-backward compatibility
(schema evolution) and validation. Beyond XML, Protostuff supports many
other formats such as JSON, YAML, protobuf, etc.

## Visualization
Smile provides a Swing-based data visualization library SmilePlot,
which provides scatter plot, line plot, staircase plot, bar plot,
box plot, histogram, 3D histogram, dendrogram, heatmap, hexmap,
QQ plot, contour plot, surface, and wireframe.

To use SmilePlot, add the following to dependencies
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.haifengl</groupId>
      <artifactId>smile-plot</artifactId>
      <version>2.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

Smile also support data visualization in declarative approach.
With `smile.plot.vega package`, we can create a specification
that describes visualizations as mappings from data to properties
of graphical marks (e.g., points or bars). The specification is
based on [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). The
Vega-Lite compiler automatically produces visualization components
including axes, legends, and scales. It then determines properties
of these components based on a set of carefully designed rules.
