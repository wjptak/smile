    <p>Many machine learning algorithms (e.g. Isomap) employ graph data structures internally.
        Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between
        objects from a certain collection. A graph is an abstract representation of
        a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links.
        The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions
        called vertices (also called nodes or points), and the links that connect
        some pairs of vertices are called edges (also called lines).
        The edges may be directed (asymmetric) or undirected (symmetric).</p>

    <p>There are different ways to store graphs in a computer system. The data
        structure used depends on both the graph structure and the algorithm
        used for manipulating the graph. Theoretically one can distinguish between
        list and matrix structures but in concrete applications the best structure
        is often a combination of both. List structures are often preferred for
        sparse graphs as they have smaller memory requirements. Matrix structures
        on the other hand provide faster access for some applications but can
        consume huge amounts of memory. In Smile, we support both adjacency list
        (class <code>AdjacencyList</code>) and adjacency matrix
        (class <code>AdjacencyMatrix</code>).</p>

    <p>In adjacency list, each vertex has a list
      of which vertices it is adjacent to. This causes redundancy in an undirected
      graph. Adjacency queries are faster, at the cost of extra storage space.</p>

    <p>An adjacency matrix is an n by n matrix A, where n is the number
      of vertices in the graph. If there is an edge from a vertex x to a vertex y,
      then the element A(x,y) is 1 (or in general the number of edges or a weight), otherwise
      it is 0. In computing, this matrix makes it easy to find subgraphs, and to
      reverse a directed graph.</p>

    <p>Both <code>AdjacencyList</code> and <code>AdjacencyMatrix</code> implement
        the abstract interface <code>Graph</code>. The basic operation on graph is
        traversal, i.e. to visit the vertices in some systematic order.
        Typically, we have breadth first search (BFS) and depth first search (DFS).
        Both of these construct spanning trees with certain properties useful
        in other graph algorithms. In <code>Graph</code>, the methods <code>bfs()</code>
        and <code>dfs()</code> returns the connected components of graph. In addition,
        the overloaded <code>bfs(Visitor)</code> and <code>dfs(Visitor)</code>
        can take a user-define <code>Visitor</code> object to perform specific
        operations when visiting a vertex.</p>

    <p>With DFS or BFS, we can also obtain the topological ordering of a directed graph, which
        is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex
        u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the
        graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints
        that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological
        ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible
        if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic
        graph (DAG).</p>

    <p>Graph traversal can be used to compute the topological ordering of graph
        by the methods <code>sortbfs</code> or <code>sortdfs</code>. The topological
        ordering of a directed graph to be one in which, whenever we have an edge
        from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>, the ordering visits <code>x</code>
        before <code>y</code>. Note that a graph has a topological ordering if
        and only if it is a directed acyclic graph.</p>

    <p>With the method <code>dijkstra()</code>, we can calculate the shortest path
        from a source to all other vertices in the graph by Dijkstra algorithm.
        Many manifold algorithms employ the shortest path among the samples as
        a similarity measure instead of pairwise distance.</p>
