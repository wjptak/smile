/**
 * Hebbian theory is a neuroscientific theory claiming that an increase in
 * synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent
 * stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic
 * plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process.
 * It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of
 * Behavior.
 * <p>
 * The theory is often summarized as "Cells that fire together wire together."
 * This summary, however, should not be taken too literally. Hebb emphasized
 * that cell A needs to "take part in firing" cell B, and such causality can
 * occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B.
 * This important aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is
 * now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal
 * precedence.
 * <p>
 * The theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which
 * simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic
 * strength between those cells. In the study of neural networks in cognitive
 * function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised
 * learning.
