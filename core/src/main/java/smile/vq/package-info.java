/**
 * Vector quantization is a lossy compression technique used in speech
 * and image coding. In vector quantization, a vector is selected from
 * a finite list of possible vectors to represent an input vector of
 * samples. Each input vector can be viewed as a point in an n-dimensional
 * space. The vector quantizer is defined by a partition of this space
 * into a set of non-overlapping regions. The vector is encoded by
 * the nearest reference vector (known as codevector) in the codebook.
