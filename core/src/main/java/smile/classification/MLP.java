/**
 * Fully connected multilayer perceptron neural network for classification.
 * An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer,
 * a hidden layer and an output layer. The nodes are interconnected
 * through weighted acyclic arcs from each preceding layer to the
 * following, without lateral or feedback connections. Each node
 * calculates a transformed weighted linear combination of its inputs
 * (output activations from the preceding layer), with one of the weights
 * acting as a trainable bias connected to a constant input. The
 * transformation, called activation function, is a bounded non-decreasing
 * (non-linear) function.
 * <p>
 * The representational capabilities of a MLP are determined by the range of
 * mappings it may implement through weight variation. Single layer perceptrons
 * are capable of solving only linearly separable problems. With the sigmoid
 * function as activation function, the single-layer network is identical
 * to the logistic regression model.
 * <p>
 * The universal approximation theorem for neural networks states that every
 * continuous function that maps intervals of real numbers to some output
 * interval of real numbers can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a
 * multi-layer perceptron with just one hidden layer. This result holds only
 * for restricted classes of activation functions, which are extremely complex
 * and NOT smooth for subtle mathematical reasons. On the other hand, smoothness
 * is important for gradient descent learning. Besides, the proof is not
 * constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of
 * the weights. Therefore, complex systems will have more layers of neurons
 * with some having increased layers of input neurons and output neurons
 * in practice.
 * <p>
 * The most popular algorithm to train MLPs is back-propagation, which is a
 * gradient descent method. Based on chain rule, the algorithm propagates the
 * error back through the network and adjusts the weights of each connection in
 * order to reduce the value of the error function by some small amount.
 * For this reason, back-propagation can only be applied on networks with
 * differentiable activation functions.
 * <p>
 * During error back propagation, we usually times the gradient with a small
 * number &eta;, called learning rate, which is carefully selected to ensure
 * that the network converges to a local minimum of the error function
 * fast enough, without producing oscillations. One way to avoid oscillation 
 * at large &eta;, is to make the change in weight dependent on the past weight
 * change by adding a momentum term.
 * <p>
 * Although the back-propagation algorithm may performs gradient
 * descent on the total error of all instances in a batch way, 
 * the learning rule is often applied to each instance separately in an online
 * way or stochastic way. There exists empirical indication that the stochastic
 * way results in faster convergence.
 * <p>
 * In practice, the problem of over-fitting has emerged. This arises in
 * convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network
 * significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. There are two general
 * approaches for avoiding this problem: The first is to use cross-validation
 * and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-fitting and
 * optimally select hyper-parameters such as to minimize the generalization
 * error. The second is to use some form of regularization, which emerges
 * naturally in a Bayesian framework, where the regularization can be
 * performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models;
 * but also in statistical learning theory, where the goal is to minimize over
 * the "empirical risk" and the "structural risk".
 * <p>
 * For neural networks, the input patterns usually should be scaled/standardized.
 * Commonly, each input variable is scaled into interval [0, 1] or to have
 * mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
 * <p>
 * For penalty functions and output units, the following natural pairings are
 * recommended:
 * <ul>
 * <li> linear output units and a least squares penalty function.
 * <li> a two-class cross-entropy penalty function and a logistic
 * activation function.
 * <li> a multi-class cross-entropy penalty function and a softmax
 * activation function.
 * </ul>
 * By assigning a softmax activation function on the output layer of
 * the neural network for categorical target variables, the outputs
 * can be interpreted as posterior probabilities, which are very useful.
