/**
 * The ratio of between-groups to within-groups sum of squares is a univariate
 * feature ranking metric, which can be used as a feature selection criterion
 * for multi-class classification problems. For each variable j, this ratio is
 * BSS(j) / WSS(j) = &Sigma;I(y<sub>i</sub> = k)(x<sub>kj</sub> - x<sub>&middot;j</sub>)<sup>2</sup> / &Sigma;I(y<sub>i</sub> = k)(x<sub>ij</sub> - x<sub>kj</sub>)<sup>2</sup>;
 * where x<sub>&middot;j</sub> denotes the average of variable j across all
 * samples, x<sub>kj</sub> denotes the average of variable j across samples
 * belonging to class k, and x<sub>ij</sub> is the value of variable j of sample i.
 * Clearly, features with larger sum squares ratios are better for classification.
