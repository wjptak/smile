/**
 * Single linkage. The distance between groups is defined as the distance
 * between the closest pair of objects, one from each group.
 * A drawback of this method is the so-called chaining phenomenon: clusters
 * may be forced together due to single elements being close to each other,
 * even though many of the elements in each cluster may be very distant to
 * each other.
 * <p>
 * Single linkage clustering is essentially the same as Kruskal's algorithm
 * for minimum spanning trees. However, in single linkage clustering, the
 * order in which clusters are formed is important, while for minimum spanning
 * trees what matters is the set of pairs of points that form distances chosen
 * by the algorithm.
