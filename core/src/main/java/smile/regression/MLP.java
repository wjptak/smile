/**
 * Fully connected multilayer perceptron neural network for regression.
 * An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer,
 * a hidden layer and an output layer. The nodes are interconnected
 * through weighted acyclic arcs from each preceding layer to the
 * following, without lateral or feedback connections. Each node
 * calculates a transformed weighted linear combination of its inputs
 * (output activations from the preceding layer), with one of the weights
 * acting as a trainable bias connected to a constant input. The
 * transformation, called activation function, is a bounded non-decreasing
 * (non-linear) function.
