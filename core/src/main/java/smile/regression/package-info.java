/**
 * Regression analysis. In statistics, regression analysis includes any
 * techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus
 * is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more
 * independent variables. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the
 * conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent
 * variables. Therefore, the estimation target is a function of the independent
 * variables called the regression function. Regression analysis is widely
 * used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap
 * with the field of machine learning.
