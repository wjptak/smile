/**
 * Kernel machines. Kernel methods owe their name to
 * the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high-dimensional,
 * implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data
 * in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between
 * the images of all pairs of data in the feature space.
 * <p>
 * Kernel methods can be thought of as instance-based learners: rather than
 * learning some fixed set of parameters corresponding to the features of
 * their inputs, they instead store (a subset of) their training set (or
 * a new representation) and learn for it a corresponding weight. Prediction
 * for unlabeled inputs is treated by the application of a similarity function.
