/** A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that starts out at
  * zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero. Like the fast Fourier
  * transform (FFT), the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is a fast, linear
  * operation that operates on a data vector whose length is an integer power
  * of 2, transforming it into a numerically different vector of the same length.
  * The wavelet transform is invertible and in fact orthogonal. Both FFT and DWT
  * can be viewed as a rotation in function space.

  /** The wavelet shrinkage is a signal denoising technique based on the idea of
    * thresholding the wavelet coefficients. Wavelet coefficients having small
    * absolute value are considered to encode mostly noise and very fine details
    * of the signal. In contrast, the important information is encoded by the
    * coefficients having large absolute value. Removing the small absolute value
    * coefficients and then reconstructing the signal should produce signal with
    * lesser amount of noise. The wavelet shrinkage approach can be summarized as
    * follows:
    *
    *  - Apply the wavelet transform to the signal.
    *  - Estimate a threshold value.
    *  - The so-called hard thresholding method zeros the coefficients that are
    *    smaller than the threshold and leaves the other ones unchanged. In contrast,
    *    the soft thresholding scales the remaining coefficients in order to form a
    *    continuous distribution of the coefficients centered on zero.
    *  - Reconstruct the signal (apply the inverse wavelet transform).
    *
    * The biggest challenge in the wavelet shrinkage approach is finding an
    * appropriate threshold value. In this method, we use the universal threshold
    * T = &sigma; sqrt(2*log(N)), where N is the length of time series
    * and &sigma; is the estimate of standard deviation of the noise by the
    * so-called scaled median absolute deviation (MAD) computed from the high-pass
    * wavelet coefficients of the first level of the transform.
    *
    * @param t the time series array. The size should be a power of 2. For time
    *          series of size no power of 2, 0 padding can be applied.

    * @param soft true if apply soft thresholding.
