/** A tensor is an algebraic object that describes a (multilinear)
  * relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector
  * space. Objects that tensors may map between include vectors (which
  * are often, but not always, understood as arrows with length that
  * point in a direction) and scalars (which are often familiar numbers
  * such as the real numbers), and, recursively, even other tensors.
  * Tensors are defined independent of any basis, although they are often
  * referred to by their components in a basis related to a particular
  * coordinate system.
  *
  * The shape of tensor (the number of dimensions and the size of each dimension)
  * might be only partially known.
