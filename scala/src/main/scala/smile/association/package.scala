/** Frequent item set mining and association rule mining.
  * Association rule learning is a popular and well researched method for
  * discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.
  * Let I = {i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>,..., i<sub>n</sub>} be a set of n
  * binary attributes called items. Let D = {t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>,..., t<sub>m</sub>}
  * be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a
  * unique transaction ID and contains a subset of the items in I.
  * An association rule is defined as an implication of the form X &rArr; Y
  * where X, Y &sube; I and X &cap; Y = &Oslash;. The item sets X and Y are called
  * antecedent (left-hand-side or LHS) and consequent (right-hand-side or RHS)
  * of the rule, respectively. The support supp(X) of an item set X is defined as
  * the proportion of transactions in the database which contain the item set.
  * Note that the support of an association rule X &rArr; Y is supp(X &cup; Y).
  * The confidence of a rule is defined conf(X &rArr; Y) = supp(X &cup; Y) / supp(X).
  * Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability P(Y | X),
  * the probability of finding the RHS of the rule in transactions under the
  * condition that these transactions also contain the LHS.
  *
  * For example, the rule {onions, potatoes} &rArr; {burger} found in the sales
  * data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and
  * potatoes together, he or she is likely to also buy burger. Such information
  * can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as
  * promotional pricing or product placements.
  *
  * Association rules are usually required to satisfy a user-specified minimum
  * support and a user-specified minimum confidence at the same time. Association
  * rule generation is usually split up into two separate steps:
  *
  *  - First, minimum support is applied to find all frequent item sets
  *    in a database (i.e. frequent item set mining).
  *  - Second, these frequent item sets and the minimum confidence constraint
  *    are used to form rules.
  *
  * Finding all frequent item sets in a database is difficult since it involves
  * searching all possible item sets (item combinations). The set of possible
  * item sets is the power set over I (the set of items) and has size 2<sup>n</sup> - 1
  * (excluding the empty set which is not a valid item set). Although the size
  * of the power set grows exponentially in the number of items n in I, efficient
  * search is possible using the downward-closure property of support
  * (also called anti-monotonicity) which guarantees that for a frequent item set
  * also all its subsets are frequent and thus for an infrequent item set, all
  * its supersets must be infrequent.
  *
  * In practice, we may only consider the frequent item set that has the maximum
  * number of items bypassing all the sub item sets. An item set is maximal
  * frequent if none of its immediate supersets is frequent.
  *
  * For a maximal frequent item set, even though we know that all the sub item
  * sets are frequent, we don't know the actual support of those sub item sets,
  * which are very important to find the association rules within the item sets.
  * If the final goal is association rule mining, we would like to discover
  * closed frequent item sets. An item set is closed if none of its immediate
  * supersets has the same support as the item set.
  *
  * Some well known algorithms of frequent item set mining are Apriori,
  * Eclat and FP-Growth. Apriori is the best-known algorithm to mine association
  * rules. It uses a breadth-first search strategy to counting the support of
  * item sets and uses a candidate generation function which exploits the downward
  * closure property of support. Eclat is a depth-first search algorithm using
  * set intersection.
  *
  * FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) uses an extended prefix-tree (FP-tree)
  * structure to store the database in a compressed form. FP-growth adopts a
  * divide-and-conquer approach to decompose both the mining tasks and the
  * databases. It uses a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly
  * process of candidate generation and testing used by Apriori.
