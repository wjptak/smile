/** Missing value imputation. In statistics, missing data, or missing values,
  * occur when no data value is stored for the variable in the current
  * observation. Missing data are a common occurrence and can have a
  * significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.
  *
  * Data are missing for many reasons. Missing data can occur because of
  * nonresponse: no information is provided for several items or no information
  * is provided for a whole unit. Some items are more sensitive for nonresponse
  * than others, for example items about private subjects such as income.
  *
  * Dropout is a type of missingness that occurs mostly when studying
  * development over time. In this type of study the measurement is repeated
  * after a certain period of time. Missingness occurs when participants drop
  * out before the test ends and one or more measurements are missing.
  *
  * Sometimes missing values are caused by the device failure or even by
  * researchers themselves. It is important to question why the data is missing,
  * this can help with finding a solution to the problem. If the values are
  * missing at random there is still information about each variable in each
  * unit but if the values are missing systematically the problem is more severe
  * because the sample cannot be representative of the population.
  *
  * All of the causes for missing data fit into four classes, which are based
  * on the relationship between the missing data mechanism and the missing and
  * observed values. These classes are important to understand because the
  * problems caused by missing data and the solutions to these problems are
  * different for the four classes.
  *
  * The first is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). MCAR means that the
  * missing data mechanism is unrelated to the values of any variables, whether
  * missing or observed. Data that are missing because a researcher dropped the
  * test tubes or survey participants accidentally skipped questions are
  * likely to be MCAR. If the observed values are essentially a random sample
  * of the full data set, complete case analysis gives the same results as
  * the full data set would have. Unfortunately, most missing data are not MCAR.
  *
  * At the opposite end of the spectrum is Non-Ignorable (NI). NI means that
  * the missing data mechanism is related to the missing values. It commonly
  * occurs when people do not want to reveal something very personal or
  * unpopular about themselves. For example, if individuals with higher incomes
  * are less likely to reveal them on a survey than are individuals with lower
  * incomes, the missing data mechanism for income is non-ignorable. Whether
  * income is missing or observed is related to its value. Complete case
  * analysis can give highly biased results for NI missing data. If
  * proportionally more low and moderate income individuals are left in
  * the sample because high income people are missing, an estimate of the
  * mean income will be lower than the actual population mean.
  *
  * In between these two extremes are Missing at Random (MAR) and Covariate
  * Dependent (CD). Both of these classes require that the cause of the missing
  * data is unrelated to the missing values, but may be related to the observed
  * values of other variables. MAR means that the missing values are related to
  * either observed covariates or response variables, whereas CD means that the
  * missing values are related only to covariates. As an example of CD missing
  * data, missing income data may be unrelated to the actual income values, but
  * are related to education. Perhaps people with more education are less likely
  * to reveal their income than those with less education.
  *
  * A key distinction is whether the mechanism is ignorable (i.e., MCAR, CD, or
  * MAR) or non-ignorable. There are excellent techniques for handling ignorable
  * missing data. Non-ignorable missing data are more challenging and require a
  * different approach.
  *
  * If it is known that the data analysis technique which is to be used isn't
  * content robust, it is good to consider imputing the missing data.
  * Once all missing values have been imputed, the dataset can then be analyzed
  * using standard techniques for complete data. The analysis should ideally
  * take into account that there is a greater degree of uncertainty than if
  * the imputed values had actually been observed, however, and this generally
  * requires some modification of the standard complete-data analysis methods.
  * Many imputation techniques are available.
  *
  * Imputation is not the only method available for handling missing data.
  * The expectation-maximization algorithm is a method for finding maximum
  * likelihood estimates that has been widely applied to missing data problems.
  * In machine learning, it is sometimes possible to train a classifier directly
  * over the original data without imputing it first. That was shown to yield
  * better performance in cases where the missing data is structurally absent,
  * rather than missing due to measurement noise.
