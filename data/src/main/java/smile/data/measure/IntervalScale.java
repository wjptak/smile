/**
 * The interval scale allows for the degree of difference between items,
 * but not the ratio between them. Examples include temperature with
 * the Celsius scale, which has two defined points (the freezing and
 * boiling point of water at specific conditions) and then separated
 * into 100 intervals. Ratios are not meaningful since 20 °C
 * cannot be said to be "twice as hot" as 10 °C. Other examples include
 * date when measured from an arbitrary epoch (such as AD) since
 * multiplication/division cannot be carried out between any two dates
 * directly. However, ratios of differences can be expressed; for example,
 * one difference can be twice another.
 * <p>
 * The mode, median, and arithmetic mean are allowed to measure central
 * tendency of interval variables, while measures of statistical dispersion
 * include range and standard deviation. Since one can only divide by
 * differences, one cannot define measures that require some ratios,
 * such as the coefficient of variation. More subtly, while one can define
 * moments about the origin, only central moments are meaningful, since
 * the choice of origin is arbitrary. One can define standardized moments,
 * since ratios of differences are meaningful, but one cannot define the
 * coefficient of variation, since the mean is a moment about the origin,
 * unlike the standard deviation, which is (the square root of) a central
 * moment.
