/**
 * The ratio scale allows for both difference and ratio of two values.
 * Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and
 * electric charge. The ratio type takes its name from the fact that
 * measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of
 * a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind.
 * A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary)
 * zero value. In comparison with Celsius scale, the Kelvin
 * temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique,
 * non-arbitrary zero point called absolute zero.
 * Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering
 * is done on ratio scales.
 * <p>
 * The geometric mean and the harmonic mean are allowed to measure
 * the central tendency of ratio variables, in addition to the mode,
 * median, and arithmetic mean. In fact, all statistical measures are
 * allowed because all necessary mathematical operations are defined
 * for the ratio scale.
