/**
 * A token is a string of characters, categorized according to the rules as a
 * symbol. The process of forming tokens from an input stream of characters
 * is called tokenization.
 * <p>
 * This is not as easy as it sounds. For example, when should a token containing
 * a hypen be split into two or more tokens? When does a period indicate the
 * end of an abbreviation as opposed to a sentence or a number or a
 * Roman numeral? Sometimes a period can act as a sentence terminator and
 * an abbreviation terminator at the same time. When should a single quote be
 * split from a word?
